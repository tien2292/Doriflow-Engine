## Features

### GPU Accelerated Fluid Solver
Our GPU-accelerated fluid solver leverages the power of modern graphics cards to perform scalable fluid simulations. This feature allows you to:

- Perform high-resolution simulations with greater efficiency.
- Faster iteration times.
- Utilize your GPU's processing power to handle complex fluid dynamics.

With GPU acceleration, Doriflow makes it possible to simulate large-scale fluid scenarios without the long wait times typically associated with CPU-based solvers.

### Two-Way Fluid Rigid Coupling
Doriflow's two-way fluid-rigid coupling feature ensures that fluids and rigid bodies interact responsively with each other. This capability includes:

- Accurate simulation of fluid forces acting on rigid bodies.
- Realistic movement and response of rigid bodies within fluid environments.
- Bidirectional interaction where fluids can affect and be affected by rigid objects.

This feature is essential for creating practical interactions between fluids and solid, such as floating shapes, submerged structures, and more.

### Whitewater Generation
Enhance your fluid simulations realism with Doriflow's whitewater generation feature. This includes:

- Creation of foam, spray, and bubbles within your fluid simulations.
- Realistic representation of turbulent fluid motion, such as breaking waves, splashes or Von Karmen vortices
- Customizable parameters to control the appearance and behavior of whitewater effects.

Whitewater generation adds an extra layer of detail and realism to your fluid simulations, making scenes involving oceans, rivers, and other water bodies more dynamic and visually appealing.
